# Example: Mixed Methods Research

## Invocation

```
/auto-academic "Faculty perceptions and student outcomes of AI-integrated curriculum in private universities facing enrollment decline" --venue "Studies in Higher Education"
```

## Expected Pipeline Trace

### INIT
- Topic: AI curriculum integration in declining-enrollment private universities
- Venue: Studies in Higher Education (SSCI, Tier 3, APA 7.0)

### RESEARCH
- deep-research (full mode) produces synthesis on enrollment decline + curriculum innovation + AI integration
- Hypotheses:
  - H1: Universities that integrated AI into curriculum show slower enrollment decline rate (regression coefficient)
  - H2: Faculty with AI training report higher self-efficacy in technology-enhanced teaching (survey scale)
  - H3: Thematic analysis of faculty interviews reveals 3+ distinct adoption barrier categories

### EXPERIMENT
- H1: Statistical comparison pattern — generate synthetic enrollment data for AI-integrated vs control universities, run regression
- H2: Survey analysis pattern — generate Likert scale data, run CFA + descriptive statistics
- H3: Text analysis pattern — generate synthetic interview transcripts, run thematic coding with inter-rater reliability
- Inner loop: ~5 runs (1 per hypothesis + 2 refinements)

### WRITE
- academic-paper (full mode) produces mixed-methods paper
- Qual-before-quant integration: thematic findings contextualize quantitative results
- Discussion triangulates across all three hypotheses

### REVIEW
- Round 1: Major Revision — reviewer questions synthetic interview validity
- Round 2: Major Revision — methodology reviewer wants robustness check on enrollment regression
- Round 3: ESCALATE — re-run H1 with additional covariates, re-run H3 with expanded coding scheme
- Round 4: Minor Revision
- Round 5: Accept (post-escalation revision addressed all concerns)

### FINALIZE
- LaTeX + PDF formatted for Studies in Higher Education
- Quality report: clean (all concerns addressed)
