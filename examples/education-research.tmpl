## Invocation

```
/auto-academic "Impact of AI-assisted formative assessment on undergraduate STEM learning outcomes" --venue "Computers & Education"
```

## Expected Pipeline Trace

### INIT
- Topic: AI-assisted formative assessment + STEM learning outcomes
- Venue: Computers & Education (SSCI, Tier 3, APA 7.0)

### RESEARCH
- deep-research (full mode) produces synthesis on AI assessment tools in STEM education
- Hypotheses extracted:
  - H1: Students receiving AI-assisted formative feedback show higher exam scores (d > 0.3)
  - H2: AI feedback frequency correlates positively with learning gains (r > 0.2)
  - H3: Student satisfaction with AI feedback is higher than traditional feedback

### EXPERIMENT
- H1: Survey analysis pattern — generate synthetic pre/post test scores, run paired t-test + Cohen's d
- H2: Correlation pattern — generate synthetic feedback frequency + score data, run Pearson correlation
- H3: Survey analysis pattern — generate Likert scale responses, run Mann-Whitney U test
- Inner loop: ~4 runs (1 per hypothesis + 1 refinement for H2 which initially shows weak correlation)

### WRITE
- academic-paper (full mode) produces IMRaD paper with APA 7.0 citations
- Includes methods describing simulated data + statistical analyses
- Results section has tables for each hypothesis test

### REVIEW
- Round 1: Major Revision — reviewer flags synthetic data as limitation
- Round 2: Minor Revision — reviewer asks for sensitivity analysis
- Round 3: Accept (after adding sensitivity analysis to experiments)

### FINALIZE
- LaTeX + PDF output formatted for Computers & Education submission
